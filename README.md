difference between academic and non academic language in structure and delivery by analyzing YouTube video
This dataset is a valuable resource for researching differences in the structure and delivery of academic and non-academic language. 
It includes a wide range of texts and audio/video recordings culled from academic papers, formal lectures, news stories, informal blog entries, and spontaneous casual interactions.
 The dataset allows for in-depth study of linguistic characteristics 
 such as sentence complexity, 
 careful word selection,
 the use of field-specific jargon,
 and the strategic placement of discourse markers. 
 Beyond textual analysis, 
 it takes into account essential delivery factors
 such as speech tempo and rhythm, 
 intonation and voice modulation,
 and visible nonverbal signs such as body language.
 The data is rigorously organised in a structured manner (e.g., .md, .txt), with detailed annotations indicating significant linguistic features. 
 This dataset is an important resource for scholars studying linguistics, education, and communication. 
 Its possible uses include the creation of novel language learning aids, 
 the improvement of communication skills in various circumstances, 
 and the examination of language's persuasive or informative influence on varied audiences.
