... ...
... ...
I know, I know.
Hurry up, T-K. I'm already late.
The last walk of our summer!
You walk by my house on your way to school every day.
Yeah,
but this year I'm on the swim team.
And I'm hopefully on the dance team.
So stop rushing.
Oh, come on.
The girls and I always walk together on the first day of school.
Yeah, yeah.
Chicken girls.
Can y'all come up with a better ship name?
Like something more mature sounding?
I just don't know.
I really bonded this summer.
You and your sister having gotten along since she started dating Henry.
They broke up.
Really?
After they broke up, she got like a really good surphotography.
And now she's taking pictures for the school and his favorite.
Check it out.
Why don't you get a phone right before the trip?
Do all of our friends have one except for me?
I don't know.
Let me check the group chat.
There's a group chat?
Kayla!
Who's Kayla?
We met a dance camp.
You're going to love her.
Hey, Queen, this is my friend Kayla.
Ellie's been helping me prep for team trials.
There's only three spots on the dance team this year.
Me, Ellie, and Rhine.
Yeah, I heard all about the chicken girls.
And the dance you did when you were five.
And you're trying to ship bracelets?
Well, who knows?
Maybe there's a fourth spot on the team.
Maybe.
That was my sis.
Who's a girl in the hoodie?
Birdie.
She's my sister's best friend, and captain of the dance team, and the coolest girl out of way.
Anyway, Ashley to class.
Wait, aren't you going to wait for a run?
It's her first day tradition.
She's one who's late.
Jeez, what's her problem?
Oh, M. She.
It's the soccer team.
That tall guy, Henry.
He used to date Queen's sister.
That Henry?
Our moms are friends.
We used to take baths together.
Baths?
Oh my gosh.
He's coming over here.
That was Sub-Kaila.
Long time no see.
Not long enough.
Hi.
I'm Kayla's friend, Ellie.
Sup.
Sup.
Anyways, Admias, that.
I'm good.
Oh, actually, here is Kayla's snap code.
All right, cool.
Zero.
Come this way.
That was amazing.
You're so weird.
He looks like a ketchup packet.
I love ketchup.
I heard his mom does his eyebrows.
That's hot.
So how have you been since the day, Henry, breakup?
I'm OK.
Queen's actually been really sweet about the whole thing.
Yeah, what's it with little sis being around all the time anyway?
Are you talking about me?
Give her a break, Woody.
Whatever.
Let's just go find home room.
What are you even listening to anyways?
This is the song we listen to when we're younger.
It gets me really pumped up.
This is going to be the best year ever.
I thought you and your girls always walk in together.
Me too.
We have English together?
Ah!
Totally recipe.
Hey, where were you this morning?
TK was so slow.
One day in the school year and you're already choosing.
Boyfriends, over, best friends.
He's just my friend.
Then maybe we could set him up with Kayla.
Who's Kayla?
Ellie's cool new friend from Dance Camp.
Don't make it too late.
She's a new friend from Dance Camp.
Don't make it too late.
She's trying out how many spots are there?
Three.
Thank you everyone.
Why don't you take five?
The team captains need to speak.
Private Lee?
Okay.
So, what you think of my sister?
I barely even noticed her.
She's never been as good as that Ellie girl.
Come on, we need her on the team.
That Kayla girls and one like that moves.
Okay, so if we take Kayla and Ellie, that only leaves warmer spot.
Then it's between Quinn and Rhyme.
Take your pick.
Did you guys notice Henry is looking at me the whole time?
He was?
Yeah, well, I mean actually he was looking at his phone.
Probably at our snapchat.
Right?
Let me see.
Okay everyone, line up.
We'd like to welcome the following new members.
Drum roll please.
Kayla Seltzer.
Quinn Forester.
Last but not least, Ellie Math.
Hey, I think this is yours.
Oh, thanks.
I was just covering for the triads.
I'm a writer for the school newspaper.
Breaking news.
Four friends try out and three make the team.
I thought you did pretty good out there.
Oh, I'm Tim Sharp.
You know, Kayla's my older cooler cousin.
I'm Ryan.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Hey, where's your new hoodie?
I didn't make a team.
What?
I know.
It's a bummer.
Hey, have you met this guy named Tim Sharp?
What about him?
I just met him.
He was pretty cool.
What do you mean cool?
I don't know, nice.
What do you mean nice?
Since Wendy of a problem with rudimentary words.
What do you mean rudimentary?
TK.
No, like for a lot of other means.
I'm not at this world.
Do you like crush on him or something?
No.
Cool.
Anyway, my sister is having her birthday party at the arcade.
Do you and your friends should stop by?
I don't know.
What if it's like a dance team thing?
Then you'll be with me.
Yeah, maybe.
Do you think your friends are cool with me hanging out with you?
Oh, yeah, of course.
Quinn can sort of be a 10-day baby.
Yeah, she's harmless.
I will say that it sucks rooms, not on the team with us though.
Look, it's Henry.
Let's check a snap.
Should we respond?
Yeah, let him know we're here.
Okay, I got dibs on Henry.
Now we need to find someone for you.
Have you met TK?
No. TK! TK!
What's up?
Hey, this is my friend Kayla.
I'm Kayla.
We met a dance camp last summer and she's new here at school.
Cool.
Nice to meet you.
So here's the deal.
Ryan and TK are best friends and he's like a brother to all of us.
What?
Don't put me in the brosum.
TK and I are hung out all summer while we were at camp.
Oh, are you guys like together?
Never really duttered that way.
I do miss her bike rides on the beach and laying them to the stars at night.
One time she spelt ice cream in her hair and then the beast warmed her.
And she jumped in the pool with all her clothes on.
That's a very specific.
That's probably the best day of my life.
That was the best day of your life.
Baby bro, will you take a photo for us?
Cute.
Can you put it on my...
No. Let her be in it with us.
Sorry I'm late.
It took me forever to wrap this.
How big deal?
Have you guys seen TK?
Uh, yeah.
It was just here.
He's the one who told me to come but it's almost like he's avoiding me.
That's because he like... Like legs?
You...
No way.
We're just friends.
Well, uh...
I think I'm gonna go play that game over there.
The one where the hero does the fighting and the power.
Yeah, the one that Henry's playing.
Oh, it's here.
No.
No way.
Do you hear that?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No way.
Do you hear that?
No way.
Do you hear that?
No. Listen up now.
Listen to me.
I'm girls in my family.
I'm strong in numbers.
It's no wonder.
Watch out world by chance.
You see, there's no stoppiness.
And I gain.
Come back, come back, Mia.
Like a boomerang.
We fly so high.
We fly together.
I get the.
We are a girl gang.
Like birds of a feather.
Birds of a feather.
We fly so high.
We fly together.
I get the.
We are a girl gang.
Like birds of a feather.
Birds of a feather.
I got to tell you already.
Much better.
Riley alarms of instructions.
Yell the tie My mom doesn't approve of my outfit, she makes me go back to my room and change.
Ryan, please, do you honestly think that Henry's gonna notice you in a head-to-toe pink outfit?
Wait, why would I care what Quinn's older sister's ex-boyfriend thinks?
Because he's the hottest guy in school.
Probably even the hottest guy in town.
Maybe even the hottest guy in the universe!
I don't know, I never went out of the country.
This shirt was like really freaking small on me, but it's what makes my muscles look good.
Be cool, he's right here.
Yeah, this way, you said.
Hey, Mom, nice to see you.
Thanks, Henry.
My mom brought them for me.
It was by one, give one free.
So, Roney, when's your big newspaper meeting?
Today, I'm really, really nervous.
Yeah, you still gonna make it to dance practice?
Yeah, totally, I'll just come after.
Sometimes I wish you were still dating, Henry.
Are you guys fighting for my locker?
We're not fighting.
We're having an adult conversation.
Can you guys be adults somewhere else?
I need to get my chemistry book.
See you later, Roney.
Jelly bean?
Only if it's a normal flavor.
What?
Are you the jerk that keeps giving people Wal-Meth flavor jelly beans?
Um, no.
Really?
I'm not going to run this.
Ah, you're disgusting.
Both of you.
Oh, yeah.
Did you find more sight?
Yeah, I was cool.
But we didn't really get to hang out.
Yeah, sorry about that.
I was thinking I could be the manager of this room team.
Really?
Yeah, then we can spend more time together.
Isn't there like some sort of dance thing you can do?
I thought you'd be happy.
Never mind.
Hey, were you just talking to that rhyme girl?
Um, yeah.
She's cool.
Yeah, she's my best friend.
Awesome.
Put out a fular for me.
Filler?
You know, ask her if she likes me.
She wouldn't like that.
She already said you're rudimentary.
Arsh, yeah.
But, you know, most girls like that with a trying to flirt.
I'm definitely going to ask her out.
Totally.
Wait, what?
What?
What?
What?
I can't.
Do I have to give you the tampon?
Let me check.
I'm the worst period ever.
Oh, yeah.
I hate my napkins.
Oh, come on, Ryan.
We all know you haven't started your period yet.
Thank you.
In honor of the first week of school, I decided to bake some gluten-free dairy free cupcakes for everybody.
All right.
My son, man, yes.
Not so fast.
Come on, you know how rare this is?
I'm allergic to gluten and dairy.
Okay, nobody's allergic to both of those things.
That's just a fad.
Plus, you pranked me yesterday.
Yeah.
Uh, washed our wardrobe behavior?
You seem sad.
I was just trying to help.
Is that an apology?
Yeah, for sure.
Fine.
You can have one, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Birdie and my sister actually taught all the girls on the dance team how to use tampons.
And Kayla.
Kayla told us the funniest story about how she learned that that dance cap her and Ellie went to.
And dance team and funny.
Kayla, Ellie, us, not you, together.
Enough about dance team.
I'm sorry.
I miss us.
I miss the chicken girls.
Well, why don't you help out with that pep rally?
What do you mean?
Dance team is performing.
And Birdie says we need help putting up posters and stuff.
That way we don't be around each other.
I don't just want to be around.
I want my friends back.
It's like everyone moved on and I didn't.
What are you doing here?
What do you think I'm doing here?
Are you here to do the make out?
Defense.
Depends on what?
If you wanted to do the make out.
You smell like strawberries.
It's like...
It's like...
It's like something in your jips.
That's because I have like seven bags.
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
No, let's go.
You prank me.
Ready for us to prank me.
I hate ready for us there.
Wait.
Am I a level three and a four?
Penny posters?
I just find some way to fill my time.
I just wanted to say sorry for being an idiot.
If you want to manage the same team, that'd be awesome.
Thanks, I guess.
I also wanted to apologize for telling Tim Sharp that he was rudimentary.
Wait, what?
He asked me if I could ask you if you were in Dome
and I just panicked.
Why'd you panicked?
Quinn, where's your sister?
She's with the newspaper team.
They love her stuff.
She'll be back soon.
Don't worry.
Is that Ryan?
Yeah.
I told her to be good at having her around.
Does she still know the dancer chains?
Well, she's painting, so I don't know if you...
Everyone take five.
Ellie and Henry totally did the make out.
What's the make out?
It's like a super romantic way of kissing.
Wow.
Incredible.
That's like your fifth bag of those.
Dad, these are like my favorite kind of chips.
I mean, I eat them all the time.
They're my thing.
Take a snap of me eating them.
We need to cool it on the chips.
There's something I have to tell you.
It's just hard to say.
Hey, little bro.
Can you talk to your girlfriend?
Huh?
Me?
Get to practice.
Practice what?
Painting your science?
You're on the team.
What?
Why, how?
You need to chose the school newspaper over us.
She's done.
But...
She won't be spotted or not.
That's what I thought.
Come get your jacket.
Sorry, TK.
What'd you want to say?
I don't know.
We ain't talking the other time.
Congratulations on making the squad.
I'm going to have to go.
Where are Brian just going?
Brady said something about like, her rejoining team?
No way.
Brian didn't just replace my sister.
This is so messed up.
Hello?
Earth to Ellie?
Oh, sorry.
What?
She's sexy and Henry.
Didn't you know they're dating now?
Ellie, you can't date my sister's ex-boyfriend?
Why not?
They literally just broke up.
Really probably ignored him.
She ignored the rest of the dance team.
Oh really?
So you're going to take the side of a guy.
You made out with once and haven't even had a real conversation with?
We've had plenty of conversations.
Yeah, about what?
Like... Salt.
And vinegar.
And chips.
Wow.
You know, you're just jealous.
Because you've never had a boyfriend.
That's not true.
I have one now.
First time hearing of it?
Maybe that's because you're too busy with sloppy seconds with your new best friend Kayla.
Fine.
Then Quinn, who's your boyfriend?
I'm dating... TK.
I know you like Ryan, but the best way to get to her is to make her jealous.
Hey girls, Peper Ali in five minutes.
I need water.
Sup, Ryan?
Are you just always around?
Or is it because you're always looking for me?
Listen, TK told me that he told you that I wouldn't want to be asked out by you.
But that's not true at all.
I'd love to be asked out by you.
Oh.
Sorry, that came out all wrong.
So, should I ask you all sometime?
How about right now?
You want to go see a movie next weekend?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, see you around.
Ryan, wait up!
Was that what you had to tell me?
If you somehow been dating Quinn this whole time, I didn't even know about it.
No, no.
She just needed my help.
Whatever.
Doesn't mean matter.
Ever since school started again, we haven't been able to hang out either.
Look, TK.
I've had a lot of fun with you this summer, but I'm on the team again.
I'm going to be a little bit more patient.
I'm going to be a little bit more patient with you.
I'm going to be a little bit more patient with you.
I've had a lot of fun with you this summer, but I'm on the team again.
I won't have a lot of time anymore.
I just wanted to give you this.
I'm going to be late for dinner.
See you around, TK.
Ryan, wait up!
What?
This is the speciality of it for me.
We're wishing for the stars we can touch the sky.
This is the speciality of it for me.
We're wishing for the stars we can't live.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
This is the speciality of it for me.
We're wishing for the stars we can't live.
Come on.
Sixth day in stretch.
Six, fifteen, full workout.
OMG, a dance workout schedule.
Ali, it's just like camp all over again.
Those are your new practice schedules.
This is pretty intense.
The regional holiday dance meet is only two months away.
And this is the team you need to be.
Power surge.
What's the power surge?
This independent company of semi-professional dancers.
They're like, unofficially the most official dance team in town.
So basically, major competition.
Let's get out of here.
Are we still on for a pair of costumes for Aces Halloween party tonight?
A pair of costumes?
As in just a two of you?
Yeah, actually me and Ali are going to dress up as Netflix and chill.
I'm Netflix and she's chill.
Not that Ali's ever been chillin her life.
Actually, I was planning on dressing up with Henry.
Let me guess, bags of chips.
Catch up with mustard.
Danny and Sandy!
What?
From Greece.
Remember?
Some of dreams ripped up the sea.
Yeah, bring a bell.
Yeah.
Anyway, I think Henry's waiting for me.
I gotta go.
See you guys later.
I thought you were going to dress up with TK.
That's all over now.
Anyways, I'm going to the party with some friends.
I'll see you later.
Well, that was weird.
You can say that again.
If you wanted to do a pair of costumes, I'm available.
But don't you and Rooney always go as salt and pepper?
We used to.
What happened?
She's probably dressing up as a Polaroid camera.
So, you in?
Sure.
Later.
Also, quit the chitchat.
My mom's yoga group will be here soon.
That was weird.
Oh, cool.
You said that again.
Hey, TK.
Got a new kid on the block.
I'll be showing the roach around.
Well, hash.
TK.
You already know each other?
Sure do.
TK is my oldest friend.
I thought you moved to Michigan.
I did, but my mom got transferred back in.
Here I am.
Great.
My work's done.
I'm going to the party.
I'm going to the party.
I'm going to the party.
Here I am.
Great.
My work's done.
I'll be in the supply closet if you need me.
Now we can finally finish our D&D campaign.
Where did we leave off?
Caves of Mordune.
Weren't you a goblin wizard?
Ooh, goblin wizard.
Who's this nerd?
Ace.
This is Flash.
Dungeon Master and Conrad. Kindergarten best friend.
We haven't seen each other in a while.
And this is Ace.
So, it's pleasure to meet you.
Whatever.
You coming to my party tonight?
Yeah, sure.
Sick.
See you around.
Goblin wizard.
Henry!
Woah, where are you off to?
To...
To you?
Oh!
To you.
So are we still going to make this party together?
I guess that's sure.
Cool!
I mean...
A chill.
See you tonight.
I know I love won't change somehow.
Work hard, live right.
I feel it in my bones right now.
So you can make this one.
You can make this one.
You can make this one.
So I want you.
Work hard, live right.
Work hard, live right.
Work hard, live right.
Work hard, live right.
Work hard, live right.
Work hard, live right.
Step one.
Scope out the snacks.
Ooh, yum.
Whoa, whoa.
I said, scope out the snacks.
Not scarf them down.
Step two.
Take the perfect photo.
Rookie.
Step three.
Scope out the competition.
Right on cue.
Is that Quinn?
O-M-G.
It's like she doesn't even see me.
Hey, where are you going?
What was that all about?
Rookie.
Aw, you dressed this pepper.
And he would be too salty without me.
I tried to replace you.
It just wasn't the same.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Hey, girl.
Oh, hi.
I thought you were too busy hanging out with Henry to notice me.
Henry's been so phone obsessed lately.
What else would it take pictures and not even talk?
I'm sorry if I've been a little bit more crazy lately.
Did you see Quinn walking with power surge?
Is she like trying out for the team or something?
She would never.
I don't know.
It feels like everyone's moving along with their lives, but I'm just stuck.
I'm sorry.
Listen up, yet listen to me.
My girl's my family.
Stronger numbers.
It's no wonder.
Watch out world watching.
See?
There's no stopping us in a game.
Come back, come back for ya.
Like a boomerang.
We fly so high.
We fly together.
We are a girl gang like birds of a feather.
We fly so high.
We fly together.
We are a girl gang like birds of a feather.
You are such a great voice.
I'd wish you sang more.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Hey, when I come to my house, I watch scary movies and eat candy.
But not too scary.
Okay, but wait too much candy.
Let's go.
Like birds of a feather.
Birds of a feather.
Feeling blue?
Yeah, a little.
How'd you know?
Have you looked in the mirror?
It was just so weird seeing TK.
Aces party was a disaster.
Have you tried talking to him?
About what?
TK has new friends now.
Maybe I should just retire to the shelf like one of my old toys.
No way.
I first got in bunny.
TK was sad.
So I took to the park just the two of us.
Now look at us.
We're playing together.
Maybe you're on to something.
Think I'd time to change.
You better.
Wait, I thought you wanted to be a DJ.
That was me.
I want to be a chef.
Can you really not tell us apart?
Honestly, not really.
But not even identical.
Capital T, Capital K, what's up bro?
I think Laney's in here.
Really?
Yeah,
but I'm not sure which one is Laney.
What's that rhyme girl doing here?
Beats me.
Still in her?
No, I'm not.
Don't show it, girl.
Act cool, blow her off.
Girls love that.
You think?
Chuss, we.
Go get it.
All right, please, bro.
Okay.
So.
I wanted to schedule some hangout time together.
Hangout time.
We've been so busy lately
and that's okay.
I just don't want to lose you in my life.
Unless your teacher was hanging out with the Raymond Wenz.
That's sure.
It's whatever.
Are you feeling okay?
More than okay.
I'm feeling TK.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I'm going to the arcade if you want to come.
Sure.
Currently I have no plans.
Absolutely none.
Zero plans.
Well, now you have plans with me.
School, I'm going day two, Sierra.
I mean, Laney.
First quen and now the Raymond Wenz.
You're a real ladies man these days.
Yeah, well.
Be chill.
Be chill.
I'm always chill.
This is ridiculous.
Can't you flirt with Henry on someone else's phone?
Just one more.
This starfish filter is doing amazing things to my cheekbones.
Well, I gotta go to history.
Leave the phone in my locker when you're done.
Okay?
Okay.
I'm going to go to history.
Leave the phone in my locker when you're done.
Okay?
Cool.
What a disaster.
What's a disaster?
Oh.
What's up Flash?
Let's take Aces of Ice and turn it be cool with the rhyme.
And now she's dating that dumb jerk Tim Sharp.
You don't need to try to be cool.
I'm not a disaster.
What's a disaster?
Oh.
What's up Flash?
Let's take Aces of Ice and turn it be cool with the rhyme.
And now she's dating that dumb jerk Tim Sharp.
You don't need to try to be cool, TK.
I think you're already cool.
Just show her that.
But she's always at dance practice.
I have an idea.
In this game, gatekeepers three, you have to initiate an alliance with someone.
And to do so, you have to follow them to their home world.
It's a long quest, but it's worth it in the end.
English, please.
If you want to be rhyme's friend again, find a way to be at dance practice.
Hmm.
Oh.
Hey.
If you're going to watch him out as we're coming.
Oh.
That's okay.
I was just leaving.
Fine.
Have you ever been away?
I used to hold you in a higher regard.
But you let me die.
And I won't be scarred.
Keep out the bad.
And bring in the good.
And the good.
Find someone to treat me like the way.
I never would.
Yeah.
True.
You gave me a rush.
But I am moving on.
Till the next crash.
Now, we're through.
But I'm over you.
No more time.
We're still a little bit more.
But you.
No more time.
We're still a little bit more.
I won't be scarred.
I won't be scarred.
I won't be scarred.
I won't be scarred.
Maybe on me.
Made it all up.
Feevings from real ones.
I had not enough.
Down my mouth.
They were bad choice.
But I'm finding my way.
By finding my voice.
It's true.
You gave me a rush.
But I am moving on.
Till the next crash.
Now, we're through.
But I'm over you.
No rose, tendin' with stabbler shot.
I'm on till the next crash.
Hey, you're pretty good.
Thanks.
I'm a dancer.
Singing's just something I do in the shower.
Well, I'm always getting a new telephone extra.
What show?
Rock your hair.
Sir, Jan, you should sing something.
Oh, this is the same days our first dance expo.
Our pure, herty's ripped.
Hey.
Take mine.
Thanks.
I'm going to sing some more.
I'm going to sing a song for you.
Sing it.
Sing it.
Sing it four times.
Oh, I haven't seen that.
Yeah,
but I have.
Why is Henry texting you?
Hey.
Hey.
What the flip is Luna doingwork here?
Luna's my friend.
She's the leader of Power Search.
Therefore, the competition.
You brought the competition into my best friend's home.
Good to see you too, birdie.
Seriously, what is she doing here, Quinn?
Do you want to tell them, or should I?
I...
I...
I...
I trained Power Search.
What?
Quinn was too good for a second-hand squad.
She decided to be a real dancer.
Oh, we'll see about that.
Power Search is going to leave your little group in the dust.
Come on, Quinn.
You have your thinking face on.
I know because there's so much to think about.
TK has a new girlfriend.
Quinn's betrayed me twice.
At least, head isn't a cloud, and Tim Sharp keeps asking me out on dates.
Isn't that a good thing?
I thought it would be, but...
No, I'm not sure.
Have you kissed him?
No. Have you held a santa?
Are they dry or clammy?
I don't know.
What's a TK's girlfriend look like?
She looks like her twin sister.
Oh, I've got to go to dance practice to start soon.
I'm circular!
So, we're done with the dancer.
That's fine.
We just gotta show that trainer exactly what she's missing.
In other news, we have a new team manager since when do we have a manager?
Since today?
Meet our newest member?
TK!
What are you doing here?
Brody made me.
Oh, my very own baby brother is going to help us stay on track.
And crush power surge once and for all.
She said I need to boost my extra particulars.
Extra curriculars.
Extra curriculars.
Curriculars.
What she said.
You're being awfully quiet and you're never quiet.
What's up?
Hello, Artie Ellie.
Why aren't you talking to me?
Why don't you ask Henry?
What are you talking about?
Heard me.
Yes, new high score.
When do you guys want to try?
Dude, whatever you're playing is not the kind of game I'm trying to play tonight.
You guys are obsessed with girls.
It's so boring.
You can say that again.
Brody, what are you doing here?
Rooney is hanging out with Hamilton and she wanted me a third wheel.
It would probably be a good idea if you blew up a little steam.
Sorry, I don't have time for all this.
Who likes food drama?
I don't either.
Ace is about him doings on you.
Why?
Because I'm trying to make his life awesome?
No, because you're turning him into a girl obsessed jerk like you.
Dang, shots fired.
Why can't you do that by playing video games like your best friend here?
Flash?
He's not my best friend.
How'd you TK?
You're turning into more of an ice cream than me.
Whatever.
Flash, wait.
I love TK.
The twins are here.
How do you have time to ride articles, do swim team, get straight A's and... Come on, they took you girls.
If you say so.
I don't know.
I just try to do the things that make me happy.
You're now my two points meeting.
We're trying to make a video.
Sorry, what was that?
Nothing.
You okay?
Yeah, I just remembered my mom is here to pick me up.
Already?
Yeah, actually, she's waiting outside right now.
I should go.
TK's totally ditched his day one buddy Flash for some crazy loser.
Why do you hear?
Because this kid is distracting him and I need him to focus on the dance team.
Sounds like a projecting birdie.
Excuse me?
You're really just upset because Rune's little sister, a day one buddy, left you for the rival dance team.
Sorry, are you my therapist?
I get up, birdie.
We're in this together.
I'm sad.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm going to be here.
Are you my therapist?
I get up, birdie.
We're in this together.
I'm sad too.
Whatever.
Rune, you're not even on the dance team anymore.
Well, I was thinking maybe I could come by to take some pictures?
Like an official photographer?
I think about it.
Ellie, what's the deal?
You totally ghosted me though, didn't I?
Oh, hey.
I'm not really interested in being one of your many girlfriends.
What are you talking about?
She's not my girlfriend.
I can't believe that you're dating Kayla.
Ellie, we're not dating.
Whatever.
You two have fun looking at your phones together.
So, what do you like to do for fun?
You know, stuff.
Cool.
I like to do stuff.
Yeah?
Sure.
What do you think?
I think that until I hit my next grocery, that sweater belongs to me.
Uh-oh. Tim Sharp?
Tim Sharp.
I can't believe I ran off like that.
I'm weird seeing TK.
Hope you got home safe.
You think we can try that again sometime?
I don't know what to do.
You could play me a song.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
For what it's worth, I hope we can be more.
We are a thousand words That's our current score.
There's that picture we took that time.
Stole it from you and now it's mine.
There's a falling ground.
Far too tired, molding on, art of facts.
Art of facts.
Different now than when we started.
Start it up.
Over time things may change.
Just that change how you feel.
I'm a little bit tired.
I'm a little tired.
I'm a little tired.
Maybe I'll just fall in love.
I'm a little tired.
I'm a little tired.
I'm a little tired.
Stop!
Can I go back to me now?
Fine.
Ellie, get your head in the game.
The dance-vegenal expo is tomorrow night
and we have to show power so they're with their up against.
And what is that exactly?
What are you doing here?
You can't dance any can't tell time?
It's 401.
That means practice is over.
Our turn now.
It's 401.
I gotta go.
Bye.
We were just finishing anyway.
We saw.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We did.
We didn't have the gym book till four.
We can't worry about them.
We just need to focus on doing our best tomorrow night.
Exactly.
What else can we do?
Uh, stake them out and steal their moves.
This is not going, Jenwell.
Hey, you better not screw up the course this weekend.
I can't wait for the show.
I'm either.
I hate that senior told us about it.
Is she gonna make it?
Yeah, um, I'm still waiting on that.
I knew vocalists were totally slow, right?
Yeah, I knew vocalists were totally into.
That's besides the point.
Whatever, as long as she can sing.
Awesome.
Okay.
One, two, three.
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
Do tomorrow night, heatwave.
That new teen club, the hottest girls are gonna be there.
I can't.
Tomorrow night, heatwave.
Tomorrow night, heatwave.
That new teen club, the hottest girls are gonna be there.
I can't.
Tomorrow night is the dance expo.
Our hersals start really early.
Dude, it's not like you're a dancer.
But I committed.
That's your decision.
You're right.
That is my decision.
So, what do you want to do about the power surge girls?
Hide in the cafeteria and use your...
What's it called again?
Zoom lens?
I like up in the competition.
I love it.
It's been way too long since our last birdie and Rene's game.
Wait, who's gonna run her hersal?
Hey, I've been thinking
and I kind of want to run dancers since the bar.
Problem solved.
Where is birdie?
She's out on a secret mission.
Because those never backfire.
It's gonna be great.
I'm here to help you all win.
Yeah, because you've always been so committed to everybody on the team.
Ryan, I'm serious about this.
I know, actually, how late is this gonna go?
Why?
Nothing.
I just need to be somewhere later.
5 6 7 8 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 4 7 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, hold 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, hold 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.
Let's just take it from the top.
Quinn, go get his waters.
I'm not taking orders from you.
That's how it was with Bertie.
She was always such a dictator.
That's why my sister quit, and that's why I had to quit.
Was I really that bad?
Whatever.
Okay, squad, listen up.
The only way we're going to crush power surge is by listening to me.
Do exactly as I say.
Practice starts now.
Let's go.
Wait.
We've been practicing for a really long time.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have something better to do?
Yeah, actually I have somewhere to be.
If that's the case, you better leave now.
Really?
Is this some kind of trick?
Get lost!
Do you think this is about Henry?
I haven't been meaning to talk to her.
I think it's about something else entirely.
You made it.
Ellie, you came.
What are you going to sing?
Oh, I don't know if I'm actually going to sing in front of anyone.
Wait, you blew off the dance just to come watch from the sidelines.
Yeah, I'm just going to show you guys on from here.
Ellie, I love your voice, and I know the audience will love you too.
But, see you itself.
I'll see you in a bit.
Thank you for joining us at this year's Dance X-Fab.
Please take a seat.
As the competition will be again shortly.
Where's Ellie?
You sent her away from rehearsal?
Well, I changed my mind.
Get her here now.
We can do this.
I'm going to sing a song.
I'm going to sing a song.
I changed my mind.
Get her here now.
We can do the dance without her.
It's just the expo, not the competition.
Just the expo.
Just the expo?
Somebody call her.
She doesn't have a phone.
Up next to the defending champions, PowerSurf.
We got the power.
Can't much more.
Oh, no.
She can't stop.
Ready for one.
We got the power.
Can't much more.
We're taking over.
What's your way inside?
We're taking over.
We're taking over.
We're taking over.
We're taking over.
We're taking over.
Oh, my God.
Good luck, Tommy.
Let's get to the warm moments out.
Good luck, friend.
Grab my heart again, Clint.
Come on, guys, you're up.
We got the power.
We got the power.
Can't much more.
She can't stop.
Is this a bad joke?
It looks like he took our moves.
It's made them terrible.
It's made them terrible.
It's made them terrible.
It's made them terrible.
It's made them terrible.
It's made them terrible.
You call yourselves the chicken girls?
More like a bunch of headless chickens.
We did the best we could.
If that was your best, you should both quit right now.
You're being so intense.
Really?
Brittany chose a new school.
She's been a good teacher.
She's been a good teacher.
You call yourselves the chicken girls?
Brittany chose a newspaper over us.
Quinchos, power surge over us.
Ellie chose...
Who knows what over us?
I'm trying to hold this team together.
Well, you're not doing a very good job with that.
Why didn't you tell us we were stealing their moves?
Because I wanted to win.
Hey, little bro.
Am I really as much of a bee as everyone thinks?
I really don't answer that.
I'll be right there.
Hey, Ron. I know things didn't go too well, but I'm so proud of you for how hard you tried.
Thanks.
You know, A's remind me to this team club and he said a lot of girls are going to be there.
Wait, what?
Yeah, he really hyped it up.
Why on earth are you telling me this?
Rhyme, let's go.
I gotta go.
Wait, I just want to say I chose not to go because I want to do a dance scene.
TK, let's go.
Hey, we have one slot left.
Do you want to give it a try?
It's okay.
I don't think anyone really wants to hear me sing.
That's not true.
I want to hear you sing.
You can't!
Wait, how did you even know?
I stole the fly from your bag.
How is the ex-boy?
Is Bernie gonna kill me?
Don't ask and definitely yes.
But you could make it up to me and just go out there and sing.
I believe in you.
Hey, sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but time's ticking.
You're lying, you got it.
You can do this.
Okay, I'm in.
I'm in.
I'm in.
Grab it.
He's holding it down.
Six feet under the ground.
And you're trying to breathe, but you can't find air.
fields.
And you're wishing you could be anywhere but here.
And you can only go so far to help you get better.
But you're still broken.
Trying to gather my thoughts.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
And I'm in.
We're using them up.
I'll catch you later.
I'm going to go to homework or something.
So.
How was the team club?
No, I was trying to tell you.
I wasn't going to go.
Instead, I chose to help the team.
Well, your help didn't seem to change anything.
I didn't notice Tim Sharp.
They're cheering you on or anything.
He's a journalist, you know.
He's a nerd.
Anyways, you deserve someone there rooting for you always.
Well, maybe I was there rooting for myself.
Hey.
Hey, I called you last night.
You didn't pick up.
I thought we were going to go to the arcade.
I'm sorry.
We're working late on a big story for the paper.
You want to watch movies tonight?
I don't want to say anything.
Say what?
Say anything.
John Kusek.
It's a classic.
Newspaper is going late tonight.
Maybe some other time?
Sure.
Sounds good.
Hey, Rooney, we need you in the library.
Like, now.
I got to go.
I'll see you around, Hamilton.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
That was good.
Yeah,
but we have to be twice as good to have a chance against power surge.
Everyone already thinks we're a joke.
Okay, it's not that bad.
We're only down two people since I joined in Rini left.
But that was before we lost Ellie and Quinn.
You don't understand.
One crack in ice and the whole frozen like shatters.
Is that a real expression?
It is now.
This is your fault.
Me?
Hell.
Something weird is going on between you and Ellie.
That's probably why she ran off.
You have to get her back.
But she won't talk to me.
So, figure something out.
Think your blood sugar's low.
Hang my weight up.
I need to know what you told Ellie.
I didn't tell Ellie anything.
That's why I told you not to tell her.
What?
Did you not check your texts?
I didn't tell Ellie anything.
That's why I told you not to tell her.
What?
Did you not check your texts?
No wonder she won't talk to me.
I gotta go find her.
Wait, wait.
Before you go, let's take a pic real quick.
Hashtag drama.
Why?
For the gram.
Oh my god.
Laugh it up.
But that really hurt.
Hey, are we still in for tonight?
What's tonight?
Dude, the date with the twins.
TK, you can't.
Star Wars Friday.
We've been planning this all week.
I'm sorry, Ace.
Can you rain-check on the twins?
What's on Star Wars Friday?
So, pretty much TK and are gonna go to his house and watch all the Star Wars movies projected on a huge wall.
Okay.
I mean...
Wait, what?
I guess we can do the arcade with the twins another night.
It's Star Wars tonight.
See you later, guys.
Peace.
And kick.
Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.
We just call it a night.
Maybe that's how it was on your own team.
But on PowerSurg, we believe in work ethic.
Don't talk about my friends that way.
They're not your friends anymore.
We are.
You're just born us again?
I have if.
I was getting my jacket.
Please.
We all know about your dirty little tricks.
I don't need tricks.
I can dance around you in my sleep.
Oh, really?
Prove it.
Outregionals.
Quinn, this is your last chance.
Are you coming with me or not?
She's with us now.
From the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.
So when I gave you my hoodie, I thought maybe I'd get it back.
But it's so comfortable.
And I'm just not ready to part with it yet.
Well, it looks better on you anyway.
I've been walking on a little something.
Do you want to hear it?
Oh, yeah.
Girl, I know you're more than just a number.
I know when I look into your eyes.
See, I can love you more than any other.
I know you've been hurt.
I'm making right.
One second.
What's up?
I came to see him.
Sorry.
Sorry that you've been texting Henry behind my back.
You're right.
I have been texting Henry behind your back.
But it's not what you think.
Whatever.
Okay, I'm moving on from this dance team stuff and from Henry.
What?
Yep, I'm quitting dance team for a good.
What?
Look, it's not about you or Henry.
Okay, regionals.
They're the same night as this concert
and I really want to sing at it.
Ellie, you can't.
I'm not even the one who's been texting Henry.
Who is?
Hey, we need to talk.
About what?
About what I've been wanting all year to get back with you.
Henry, we can't do this.
If Ellie found out, it would break her heart.
Ellie and I are totally over.
Let's just forget that ever happened.
Henry, I had a crush on you.
Like forever
and then we dated
and then you cared more about taking pictures of us than actually being together.
It'll be different this time, I promise.
I've moved on Henry and so have you.
Time will let go.
So you told her about Ronnie.
I was covering for them for too long.
Covering what?
A few weeks ago, Kayla saw Henry and Ronnie kissing after school.
We were too scared to tell Ellie.
Wow, that's juicy gossip.
Well, it doesn't matter now.
Ronnie has a new man in her life and a new hobby.
And we're still sure to dance her.
Too bad I'm not old enough to join the team.
Hi.
Hi.
I've just been soaking into these about everything.
Chicken girls, power surge.
It's like I don't even know who I am anymore.
You and me both sister.
Don't worry.
Everything will work out in the end.
I hope.
I have so too.
Also, mom wants to know why some weird guys playing music outside.
What?
Is in your eyes.
The light the heat in your eyes.
I am completing your eyes.
I see the doorway.
Your eyes.
2,000 churches.
Your eyes.
The resolution.
Your eyes.
I'm all the foolish searches.
Sorry, Tim Sharp, but it looks like those tickets belong to me.
Hmm.
He spoke too soon.
Looks like we're tied.
Guess we're gonna have to go for another round.
Guess so?
Wow, wasn't expecting that.
Tim, so sorry.
I just got nervous.
Let me go get you some tickets.
Ron, you're not gonna come say hi?
Hi, Ace.
Hi, TK.
Why do you always bring us to this dumb arcade?
Can't we go to the mall or the movies or something?
Yeah, the movies.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Catch you around.
Let's go.
Well, that's rude.
It's so weird.
Birdie's been completely MA this weekend.
She must be really upset about something.
I don't get it.
Didn't Birdie kick you out the dance team?
She's so mean.
Yeah,
but she's still my partner in crime.
I thought I was your partner in crime.
No, you're just helping me with the geometry.
So like I was saying, the shortest distance between two points is a line.
And if you bike west on stage treat for one mile, you could probably still catch pretty intense practice.
Really?
You wouldn't mind?
I'd be mad if you didn't.
Thanks.
Plus your parents don't even let us close the door anyways.
Hey.
Hey, um, about last night.
You know what?
I don't have this conversation again.
We're friends, right?
Friends go on dates with other people?
Yeah.
Friends.
Guys, I got a text from Birdie.
We're four fitting regionals.
Powersters are just going to win by default.
What?
We can't let that happen.
Guys, have you seen Birdie?
She isn't coming.
She wants to drop out of room.
What?
You're her best friend.
What do we do?
I've got an idea.
Oh, go away.
Brought you donuts.
What are you guys doing?
I've got a lot of things to do.
I've got a lot of stuff to do.
I've got a lot of stuff to do.
I've got a lot of stuff to do.
I've got a lot of stuff to do.
I've got a lot of stuff to do.
What are you guys doing here?
We can't four fit regionals.
No Ellie, no regionals.
We have to get her back.
It doesn't matter.
Powersters are just better than us anyways.
Even going to a rather be with Luna, then it'd be like me.
No, don't say that.
You're the best big sister anyone could ever ask for.
And the best dance team captain.
And you're my best friend.
And honestly, I really look up to you sometimes.
I mean all the time.
You guys are just saying that because dance is the only thing I care about.
No.
We mean it.
Are there any chocolate donuts in there?
Yeah.
Okay.
No, that was it.
That was right.
That was good.
You know, everybody really likes having you in the band.
Even Calvin.
I mean, you can get a little testy, but your voice speaks for itself.
Well, what about you?
Do you like having me in the band?
I do just accept for one thing.
And what's that?
I have a rule against dating people I sing with.
Well, maybe you should have mentioned that before you recruited me to be in your band.
Sorry to interrupt.
Again, chingirls are in a time of crisis.
I need to talk to you.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
I'm miles, by the way.
I'm Keela, by the way.
All right.
What can I help you with?
Everything is falling apart.
And I can't talk to Quinn or TK about it.
You can talk to me.
I mean, I guess.
But it's just not the same.
I just wish everything could go back to the way it was.
That's how Teddy felt when I first got bunny.
He didn't know how much fun the three of us could have together.
Wow.
You were wise beyond your years.
Can you sing me a song?
Sure.
For what it's worth, I hope we can be more.
We are thousand words that's our current score.
There is that picture we took that time.
Stolen from you and now it's mine.
I imagine this could happen, but don't know how you feel.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Maybe found my other half.
Maybe your way is a photograph.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Maybe found my other half.
Maybe your way is a photograph.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Maybe found my other half.
Maybe your way is a photograph.
Okay.
So, what have we found someone who looks just like you to sing at the concert?
But nobody looks just like her.
Okay.
So, what if you sing at the concert and my stepmom picks you up and drove you to dance me?
Traffic.
There's no way we would make it.
What if you just ran all the way from there?
Kingla, I can't be at both the dance meet and the concert.
I can't be in two places at one time.
Ladies, I may have a suggestion.
And?
Hey, is Quinn home?
Uh, yeah,
but I'm not too sure she's going to want to see you.
Don't tell her it's me.
Quinn, Pete's is here!
What?
I didn't know.
I'll leave you to him.
Can we talk?
Quinn, this is crazy.
We can't just not be talking.
We're Quinn and Ryan.
I've known you since you told everybody in preschool that you wanted to turn your name to Rainbow.
And now that you're moving on from Chicken Girls, what are you talking about?
The Chicken Girls moved on from me.
You're the one who joined the rival dance team.
Because you were all too preoccupied with Boydrum and that noticed me.
Is that really how you feel?
I just thought you were way too cool for me now.
That's what I thought about you.
Really?
This whole time?
Yeah.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
And I'm sorry if I ever ignored you.
I'm sorry I joined Power Search.
I just wanted the old Chicken Girl feeling back.
But it was not what I had expected.
Friends again?
Friends again.
Give me one second.
I found this a few weeks ago.
TK dropped it.
I would have given it to you sooner, but...
What is it?
And how do we're talking again?
There's a lot I need to fill you in on.
Chicken Girls.
Chicken Girls.
Chicken Girls.
Chicken Girls.
Chicken Girls.
So Sierra and Lady's parents are going out of town this weekend.
Let's throw a massive break.
I can't.
I have the holiday dance game.
So?
So?
I'm the manager of the team.
I thought they had a forfeit anyways.
Maybe they're just in case.
It's super important to my sister.
So you're telling me you'd rather hang out with the Chicken Girls than two cute twins?
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
Me?
Both of you.
Ace, you're a jerk that cares about nobody except himself.
In TK, you're just as bad.
You don't want to go to the meat for your sister.
You want to go to see Ryan.
What are you talking about?
You know what?
You guys can go on your wild goose chases.
I'm over it.
And now TK is a new girlfriend, Lanie.
You know he was never my boyfriend.
Right?
He was just helping me stand out, Ellie.
Well now I know.
Everything's just so weird.
I thought nothing could come between us.
Anyway, we really miss you on the dance team.
I know.
I miss you guys too.
And with the dance mate tomorrow.
I can't come back.
Why not?
You don't know Luna.
If I quit power surge, she'll kill me.
Maybe you literally.
But Quinn.
Or Birds of a Feather.
We fly together.
Go away TK.
I believe I'm not TK.
I don't want you to see me like this again.
Like what?
Like weak and sad and not in total control.
You're not weak.
And you're just going through a hard time.
You're alive.
You're alive.
You're alive.
You're alive.
You're a lot of be sad.
Sad?
You said I was sad.
You did literally two seconds ago.
Bertie, listen.
I know you have this tough girl image that you like to keep up
but... Nobody can be tough all the time.
I think I want to be friends with somebody with no emotions.
I thought that was my people like me.
I'm not about anybody else
but... I like you for you.
Now.
Come on, you gotta get up.
What's the point?
The dance mate was everything to me.
And now we can't even compete.
I'm not necessarily.
Can I join you?
That depends.
Am I talking to my friend TK or Aces for NTK?
I just want to say thanks for before.
But like, putting things in perspective.
That's what I'm here for.
I'm happy you back in town.
Need to.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, where is Quinn?
The dance meet is tomorrow.
She's going to be on this team's laundry duty for months.
What's happening?
Okay guys, don't freak out.
I'm not talking to you.
I realize something is happening.
It's probably just like a...
I'm sorry.
It's the light.
Luna, I quit.
See you all the dance meet tomorrow.
IS IT HERE?
Never mind.softly Are you sure this will work?
For my whole day of dancing....
I think I'm in love.
Just don't give my number this time.
Just don't give him my number this time.
Okay.
I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.
But I don't have a phone, though.
That's your problem.
I'm sorry.
Oh, wait up.
Hey, cousin.
Hey, Tim.
How's Uncle Mike?
Uh, you know, he's good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What's up?
The other night, I tried to kiss Ryan, and she spit sort of, like, all over my face.
Is she not into me?
She's probably just nervous.
I don't think she kissed that many boys.
Or any boys.
God.
I don't know.
I just feel like she's always thinking about someone else.
Anyways, I gotta go interview someone for the paper.
Both of them, so they have to wait all the day, damn please.
No sign of Ellie.
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
Show starts in three minutes.
Can I worry now?
Hey, don't mean it in her up.
Tim.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
Just came to give you these.
To wish you good luck.
Thank you.
That's a thoughtful of you.
I'll be in the front row, turn you on.
See you out there.
I gotta go change my shirt anyways.
I'll see if Ellie's out there.
The balance is like, we're at capacity.
And I'm like, are you kidding me?
Who do you think they're all here to see?
Ace.
I'm Ace.
Duh.
Hey girls.
Ace.
Don't support your boyfriend at the dance meet.
Well, if you mean being supportive of TK, then yes, I'm going to the auditorium.
How are you gonna do that?
That can pass me.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dog.
I did not realize how short you were.
I did realize how lame you are.
Well, you wanna go?
Hey, hey, stop.
Hey, you're breaking up.
This loser's the one who pushed me.
He started it.
Guys, the meeting's about to start.
And Ellie's not here.
And I have to wait about you two.
Listen, TK, I put up with this guy for a long enough.
It's time you gotta decide.
Either him or me.
No one's gonna choose you.
You're an arrogant jerk.
So you wanna go?
Guys, we can't do this right now.
Let's talk out to the dance.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Are the girls on next?
I think so.
I'm really nervous.
Yo, what's up?
Hey.
Oh, my bad.
I'm Henry.
Hey, I'm Hamilton.
Yeah, I know you.
Are you one of hands with my girl?
I'm nobody's girl, especially not yours.
Well, it is hamburger here.
Know about us hanging out recently.
What?
Is that true?
I don't remember when you were supposed to go to arcade with her.
Well, she was with me instead.
Wait, Rune, is this true?
No.
Well, yes, but I mean it's complicated.
It doesn't seem complicated.
In fact, I understand perfectly.
Have fun together.
I'm sorry.
Well, does that mean we can be together now?
I hate you and your total jerk.
I'm never being with you.
Are you going to go after him?
It's okay to be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Okay, I'm nervous.
But Ellie needs to be here.
I'm telling you she will be.
This is a last part of PowerStage's routine.
Are you ready for this?
Got my eyes on you?
Keep me in my lane.
Keep me in the loose.
Woo!
Woo!
Let's give it up for PowerStage.
Up next is our home team, the At-way Armadillos.
What do we do?
I don't know.
I think you're going to have to go home without her.
No, I'm telling you she will be here.
Well, we can't wait for her.
They're literally about to clear a song.
Guys, Kayla's right.
Birdie, we're a team.
We can't go on without Ellie.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
You guys, move it.
I'm carrying a whole drum set.
No excuse.
There's a dance on the line.
Who's the chicken?
You're lucky I love you.
Is this At-way High?
Oh my gosh.
Where did you get a chicken costume?
Do you guys know what he's doing?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Do you guys know what he's doing?
Who's the chicken?
He's saving his shell.
I'm here.
What did I miss?
Just that.
Okay.
Gotta go.
Wait.
You just got to leave her.
It's okay.
Just wait.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce the chicken girls.
Err, sorry, I mean the out-of-way high dance team.
For them, go buy the chicken girls.
It's a friendship name.
Well, anyway, here they are.
What's she doing?
She couldn't be in two places at once, so she's bringing the concert to dance to me.
When do we dance?
Now.
I can't hold back.
I can't help but scream out.
We run stuff, but we're like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Like a way.
Who wants to come up on stage and dance with us?
Where are you going?
Oh, come on, Luna.
Looks like they're having so much fun.
I think we have a clear winner for an out-of-way high.
This isn't over.
Did you mean what you said backstage?
What I said, you mean, do you love me?
I love you.
